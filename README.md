TriX Gaming DApp is a **simulated Web3 PvP betting platform** where players stake GT tokens, join or create matches, and compete for winnings. Matches auto-complete, and winners are randomly selected by the system.  
This project demonstrates **blockchain-inspired game logic** with wallet integration, token staking, and live updates, all running in a browser environment.

## ⚙️ Technical Approach

This DApp is **off-chain simulated**, meaning:
- No actual blockchain smart contract is deployed.
- The logic runs entirely in the browser via **JavaScript**.
- Wallet interactions are simulated for demonstration purposes.

The **random winner generation** uses JavaScript’s randomization, ensuring fairness within the simulation.
